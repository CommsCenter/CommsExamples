# Styles (Collections?)
Styles are custom CSS rules that can override existing CSS and elements, or define new classes to work with.

## Dependencies
When you re-style existing lists, items, pages, components, layouts or headers, you can reference them, so users can add your style and dependant components at the same time.

## Note
Styles (Collections) are meant for reusable CSS only.
